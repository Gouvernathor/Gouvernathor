# Hi !

I am a french-speaking developer mainly dedicated to creating and maintaining tools for the creation of visual novels,
or related to constitutional law and political science.

## Ren'Py
I have been contributing to the main [Ren'Py repository](github.com/renpy/renpy) since late 2020,
and I am currently one of its maintainers.

I'm also developping additional tools and snippets which can help creating games in Ren'Py, for example :
* [ChromaGlitch](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/renpy-ChromaGlitch), a glitching effect
* [SWHolo](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/renpy-SWHolo), a hologram effect similar to the Jedi council in Star Wars
* [PronounsClass](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/renpy-PronounsClass), a class to help managing player-chosen or otherwise dynamic pronouns
  for possibly multiple characters
* [AttributesManager](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/renpy-AttributesManager), a toolkit to help managing the attributes passed to images
  (layeredimages in particular).

## Politics
I am currently hosting a saved (and multilingual) version of [PolitiScales](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/gouvernathor.github.io),
which disappeared from its original website along with the repository hosting its code (of which this was originally a fork).

I am also hosting a revamped and repaired version of the [ParliamentDiagram tool](https://parliamentarch.toolforge.org/archinputform.php)
([my repo](https://github.com/Gouvernathor/parliamentdiagram), [original repo](https://github.com/Slashme/parliamentdiagram),
[original website](https://parliamentdiagram.toolforge.org/parlitest.php)), whose purpose is to create beautiful and solemn displays of the political groups
in a chamber of Parliament. You've probably already seen one of our diagrams, if you went on the Wikipedia page of a legislative assembly.

## Miscellaneous
I am incidentally registered as a contributor to the cpython repository, because I once removed two repeated sentences in the documentation. Yes, I basically saved the world.
